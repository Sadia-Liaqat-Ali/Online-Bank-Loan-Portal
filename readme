- **Loan Officers**: review applications, update statuses, track repayments
- **Administrators**: manage loan types, users, view dashboards & reports

## 🛠️ Setup & Credentials

1. **Database**  
   - Import `loanportal.sql` into your MySQL/MariaDB server.  
   - Update `dbconnection.php` with your DB host/user/password.

2. **Default Login Credentials**  
   - **Administrator**  
     - Email: `admin@gmail.com`  
     - Password: `123`  
   - **Loan Officer**  
     - Email: `aishh@gmail.com`  
     - Password: `aish`  
   - **Sample Customer**  
     - Email: `sadia@gmail.com`  
     - Password: *sadia*  

3. **Customer Accounts**  
   - New customers can register via `Customer/register.php`.  
   - Passwords are hashed with PHP’s `password_hash()` for security.

4. **Environment Variables (Optional)**  
   Instead of hard-coding, you can create a `.env` with:
   ```
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_NAME=loanportal
   DB_USER=root
   DB_PASS=your_password
   ```
   Then update `dbconnection.php` to read these values.

## 💡 Quick Tips

- **Uploads**: All payment proofs go to `uploads/repayments/`—ensure the folder is writable.  
- **Security**: Don’t commit real credentials; use placeholders or a `.gitignore`’d `.env`.  
- **Debugging**: Enable `display_errors` in `php.ini` during development; disable in production.
